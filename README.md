I implemented multithreaded functions in C to efficiently compute the maximum value and sum of large arrays, reducing array processing time by 50% through parallel processing of 10 million elements across 800 threads. By conducting detailed performance analysis, I achieved a 40% reduction in user and system time, enabling sub-second execution for datasets exceeding 1 million elements. I also compared the results with single-threaded implementations to ensure accuracy and validate the performance gains.
